## How to pass this course
This course gives you a way to prove your Excel and Copilot skills to employers. To qualify for the certificate, you have to enroll in the program, pay the fee, and pass the graded assessments. If you don't want to pay, you can still access the course free of charge. This lets you view all videos and submit practice quizzes as you learn. One thing to remember though, this option doesn't let you submit assessments, earn a grade, or receive the certificate.

## How deadlines work
When you enroll in the course, the system automatically sets a deadline for when you need to complete each section. Heads up: These deadlines are there to help you organize your time, but you can take the course at your own pace. If you "miss" a deadline, you can just reset it to a new date. There's no time limit in which you have to finish the course, and you can earn the certificate whenever you finish.
