# Creating reports with and without templates                              
## High-level overview                      
Creating effective reports involves more than compiling data—it requires deciding when to use templates and when to create custom reports from scratch. Templates provide structure and speed, while custom reports allow for greater flexibility.

This reading introduces a decision-making framework to guide you in choosing the right approach and explores advanced Copilot features for collaboration in both workflows.

## Learning objective                   
By the end of the reading, you will be equipped to strategically decide between using templates or customized reports based on task-needs analysis, and then leverage Copilot in Excel for advanced collaboration for dynamic report creation.

## A new decision-making framework: Choosing the right approach     
Rather than relying solely on availability, use the following criteria to select between templates and custom reports:

## The complexity of your data needs                 
Use templates if the data is straightforward and follows a predictable structure.

Create custom reports for complex, multi-layered datasets that require unique insights or visualizations. An e-commerce company analyzing customer demographics, purchase history, and inventory levels to identify the most profitable products during seasonal promotions, customizing their reports to visualize these many different interactions for stock optimization, and to target key customer segments, is one example of a multi-layered dataset. 

## The frequency of use                
Use templates for reports generated regularly, such as monthly performance reviews.

Build custom reports when dealing with ad-hoc projects or one-off analyses.

## Your time constraints       
Templates allow for quick generation of reports when time is limited.

Custom reports require more time but offer greater adaptability for tailored insights.

## How to use Copilot in Excel                                
Copilot can assist in evaluating these criteria by analyzing your dataset, and either recommend using a template or customizing your layout.
