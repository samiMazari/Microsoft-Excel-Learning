## Sales analysis for Fusion Roller                       
It’s time for you to present all your sales analysis findings from Fusion Roller’s sales for the last year in a comprehensive report. You know how to create PivotCharts, but now you want to focus on applying more advanced tools to create PivotCharts that display filtered data, show precise sales figures, and compare these different data metrics.

Here are some helpful guidelines for filtering data by region, adding data labels, and combining sales and returns into a single chart, to provide your stakeholders with a true reflection of the net sales of the past year.

Tip: Before starting, take a moment to check the quality of your dataset—ensuring that there are no duplicate entries or missing data points—as these can impact the accuracy of your charts.

**1. Filtering data by region**                    
If you want to focus on sales from a specific market, such as North America, you can ask Copilot to filter the data.

Filtering your PivotChart based on specific criteria—like regions, for example—enables a more targeted analysis, allowing you to focus on key markets or segments.

Example prompt to try: How can I filter my PivotChart to show only North American sales? Copilot will provide step-by-step instructions to follow and apply regional-based filters to your charts.

Tip: Save commonly used filters as part of your PivotTable settings to apply them quickly and easily across similar charts in the future.

**2. Adding data labels**              
While a basic PivotChart only displays visual summaries, adding data labels will highlight exact sales figures directly on your chart.

Therefore, adding data labels to display exact numbers on each bar of your chart allows the reader to see specific values easily and improves the clarity and precision of your visualizations.

It will also help identify different wheel types or shoe categories when the data is visualized in a combined chart to compare their overall sales performances.

Try this example prompt in Copilot: How can I add data labels to show sales figures on my PivotChart?

Tip: Use data labels selectively. For dense datasets, adding too many labels can quickly clutter the chart. Rather focus on the key metrics you want to convey or summarize the totals for clarity.

**3. Combining sales and returns in a single chart**           
To better understand sales trends and compare the performance of different categories over a specific period of time, you may want to compare multiple metrics in one chart—for example, sales and returns.

And, combining multiple data metrics into a single PivotChart can help to compare different factors side by side, providing all the relevant details to understand both product performance and customer behavior in a single visualization.

Try this example prompt for Copilot to guide you through the process of combining different metrics: How can I add returns data to my sales PivotChart? 

Tip: Use contrasting colors or markers to differentiate between metrics in combined charts, making it easier for your audience to interpret the data.

## Conclusion     
With these advanced techniques, you can enhance your PivotCharts using Copilot in Excel by filtering data, adding labels, and combining multiple metrics. These skills allow you to create more detailed and customized visualizations, helping you to communicate the key performance metrics clearly and understand your data insights better.

## Exploring product performance at Fusion Roller           
Fusion Roller is a unique company known for its innovative sneaker skates that allow customers to switch seamlessly between walking and skating.

And, as a member of the sales department, you are tasked with analyzing product performance across the company’s entire catalog. Your goal is to identify best-sellers and uncover trends to explain why these products resonate so well with your customers. 

The following guidelines will help you explore advanced data transformations to highlight key trends that will help to improve your data insights.

**1. Advanced sorting for enhanced clarity**                          
When you first create a basic PivotChart, the data is displayed exactly as it’s arranged in the original dataset. To make your charts more impactful, try sorting the data by specific metrics—like sales figures or dates—to immediately highlight key trends. For example, sorting sales performance by shoe categories, alongside wheel type and use, can help Fusion Roller prioritize its most popular products in the chart.

Try this example prompt in Copilot: How can I sort my PivotChart by the highest sales first?

**2. Applying conditional formatting**                                
With conditional formatting in PivotCharts, you can visually emphasize key metrics by changing the appearance of certain chart elements, based on a set of conditions; for example, highlight bars in a bar chart where the sales exceed a certain threshold.

Thus, by incorporating conditional formatting, you can visually highlight specific data points that meet your specified criteria— like products with sales over 1,000 units—allowing you to identify data outliers or important trends at a glance.

Use this example prompt: How can I apply conditional formatting to my PivotChart?

**3. Multi-level comparisons**            
While standard PivotCharts offer single-level comparisons—like only comparing sales performance between the different sneaker categories—adding multi-level comparisons can help you identify different relationships between data points.

For example, when applying multi-level comparisons to your PivotChart, you might discover that Canvas-type sneakers sell best in North America, while the high tops category performs better in Europe.

Try using this example prompt: How can I create a PivotChart that compares sales by both sneaker type and region?

**4. Customizing data series for visual impact**              
In addition to filtering and sorting your dataset, customizing individual data series—such as changing the colors for each product type or line style for each region—adds clarity and distinction to complex PivotCharts, and helps readers differentiate between multiple categories within the same chart.

For example, using different styles to identify the bars for each different sneaker type, can make it easy for Fusion Roller’s stakeholders to visually distinguish between these categories, making it easier to interpret the data of each category.

You can try this example prompt in Copilot: How can I customize the colors in my PivotChart for each sneaker type?

**5. Using calculated fields for deeper insights**                      
Beyond the data already included in your dataset, you can use calculated fields to introduce new metrics into your PivotChart.

Adding calculated fields enables you to perform additional analyses within your PivotChart, such as calculating the percentage of total sales contributed by each product or identifying the average sales per product category. This helps deepen your understanding of the data and uncover trends that may not be visible immediately.

For example, you might want to compare average sales per region and be able to calculate the percentage of total sales for each product within a specific region.

Prompt Copilot with this example: How can I add a calculated field to my PivotChart?

**6. Creating combo charts for multi-metric analysis**              
When your analysis requires tracking multiple metrics—such as comparing sales figures and return rates—combo charts allow you to display two or more data series in the same chart. 

Therefore, combo charts can provide a more comprehensive view of overall product performance. For example, use a bar chart to represent sales data alongside a line graph that tracks returns, to help identify the correlations between these two metrics.

Try this example prompt: How can I create a combo chart to show both sales and returns?

## Conclusion
