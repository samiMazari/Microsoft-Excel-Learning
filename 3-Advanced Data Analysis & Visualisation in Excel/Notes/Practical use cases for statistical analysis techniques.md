# Practical use cases for statistical analysis techniques             
## High-level overview                       
Understanding customer feedback is crucial for improving products or services. However, with large datasets, identifying patterns and spotting outliers can be difficult. Copilot in Excel’s function helps by automatically highlighting important trends. In this reading, you will focus on applying statistical techniques to analyze customer feedback for actionable insights.

**Learning objectives**      
By the end of this reading, you will be able to:

identify and interpret key data patterns in customer feedback

recognize outliers and their significance in data analysis

explain relationships between different variables in customer feedback data

**Spotting outliers in customer feedback**          
Outliers are feedback points that deviate significantly from average sentiment. These can be highly positive or highly negative but both provide important insights.

For example, in feedback for a new product, most reviews might hover around 4 stars, but a few outliers may rate the product as 1 star. Identifying these outliers can reveal issues that could damage the product's reputation.

Example prompt: Highlight any outliers in customer satisfaction ratings for the new product launch. This allows you to focus on extreme cases and investigate the reasons behind them.

**Analyzing relationships in feedback data**             
Understanding relationships between feedback data and different aspects of the business can reveal what drives customer satisfaction. For instance, identifying a correlation between shipping time and overall satisfaction can help improve customer experience.

Example prompt: Show the correlation between response time and satisfaction scores.

If quicker response times lead to higher satisfaction, you can prioritize fast support in your service strategy.

**Practical applications**      
Statistical techniques such as box and whisker plots are valuable tools for visualizing feedback trends, outliers, and data distribution.

**Visualizing outliers**     
Box and whisker plots are effective for identifying outliers in customer feedback. These plots show how far the high and low points (whiskers) deviate from the central tendencies (mean and median), providing insights into extreme feedback points that simple averages can’t capture. If most feedback is positive but a few customers consistently leave 1-star reviews, a box and whisker plot will highlight these outliers. Addressing these outliers can help resolve issues for a specific customer group, leading to broader customer satisfaction.

Example prompt: Create a box and whisker plot for customer satisfaction ratings over the last quarter.

This will visualize both average ratings and outliers, helping you investigate outlier cases.

**Analyzing the gap between the highest and lowest ratings**               
The gap between the highest and lowest points in a box and whisker plot can reveal how much customer opinions differ. If feedback ranges from 1-star to 5-star ratings, the box and whisker plot shows how wide the gap is between the highest and lowest ratings. A large gap may indicate inconsistent customer experiences, suggesting potential product quality or service delivery issues.

**Improving product development with feedback analysis**                 
Box and whisker plots can help you identify patterns that influence product development. They provide a clear picture of areas where products excel and where they may fall short. If a feature receives a mix of very high and low ratings, the box and whisker plot will show this divergence. This suggests the feature works well for some but creates challenges for others, guiding product teams in refining the feature for a better user experience.

Example prompt: Generate box and whisker plots for each feature’s feedback. Then, use the plot to identify areas that need further refinement.

**Conclusion**          
Box and whisker plots are powerful for visualizing customer feedback distribution, identifying outliers, and understanding the gap between the highest and lowest ratings. By using these techniques alongside other statistical methods, businesses can gain deeper insights into customer sentiment. 

With Copilot, generating these plots and deriving actionable insights becomes efficient, helping you make decisions to improve your customers’ experiences.
