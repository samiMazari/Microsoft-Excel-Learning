## Best practices for effective visuals using Copilot in Excel              
**1. Enhancing accessibility through dynamic Copilot feedback**                
Accessibility in data visualization ensures that all users, including those with disabilities, can engage with your content. Copilot not only applies accessible colors but can also flag elements that could present barriers and suggest corrections in real time. With guidance from Copilot, you can scan and highlight your chart to indicate any non-compliant color schemes or patterns that need adjustment.

Example prompt: What accessibility issues exist in this chart?

Tip: Automate Copilot’s accessibility checks to run whenever new visualizations are added, ensuring continuous compliance without manual effort.

**2. Optimizing legends and labels with interactive features**                   
Next, clear legends and concise labels can make your visualizations more intuitive. For instance, interactive legends with slicers allow users to control what data is being displayed, improving the flexibility and engagement of data visualizations. Copilot can help you with integrating slicers to make your charts more interactive by allowing users to filter the data dynamically.

Example prompt: Enable slicers in the legend for this chart.

Tip: Use interactive legends to avoid clutter—only display relevant data based on user input, keeping your visual clean and focused.

**3. Automating layout adjustments for maximum impact**                            
Lastly, layouts that align with your presentation needs can enhance the visualization’s readability and engagement. With Copilot in Excel, you can automatically adjust the spacing, margins, and positioning to fit various display environments, from reports to presentations. Thus, make use of Copilot’s guidance to adjust element positions, to ensure your visuals remain polished and legible in all presentations.

Example prompt: Optimize the layout of these charts for slideshow mode.

Tip: Use adaptive layouts for different formats—Copilot can help rearrange elements based on screen size or presentation settings.

And lastly, consistency across multiple visuals ensures that your reports and dashboards are easy to interpret. Copilot in Excel can help you to create reusable templates that maintain design standards across your many projects, by saving the design (including your specific colors, fonts, and layout settings) for future use.

Example prompt: Create a reusable template for quarterly reports.

Tip: Use reusable templates to ensure consistency across recurring reports and dashboards, reducing lengthy manual rework.

## Conclusion
