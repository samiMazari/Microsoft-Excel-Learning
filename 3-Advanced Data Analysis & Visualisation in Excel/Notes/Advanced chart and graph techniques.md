Creating effective visualizations requires more than selecting advanced chart types; it also involves crafting visuals that reveal hidden patterns and respond dynamically to new data. Copilot in Excel enhances this process by automating complex chart configurations and suggesting new ways to visualize trends.

This reading focuses on layered combo charts, multi-template integration, and predictive elements, equipping you with innovative techniques to unlock deeper insights from complex datasets.

## Learning objective                          
By the end of the reading, you will have mastered advanced techniques for creating dynamic and actionable visualizations by exploring layered combo charts, multi-template chart integrations, and predictive elements with Copilot in Excel.

## Unique advanced chart techniques                                       
The following are three unique advanced techniques that you can apply to improve your charts and graphs to generate more informed and actionable insights.

**1. Using layered combo charts for multi-dimensional insights**                          
Layered combo charts use multiple chart types on the same axis, offering both high-level summaries, and detailed insights within a single view. For example, you can track product sales trends with bars and forecast future growth with lines—all within the same chart. And, with the guidance of Copilot, you can align the axes and assign appropriate visuals for each metric.

Example prompt: Create a combo chart that layers actual and forecasted sales. 

Tip: Use layered combo charts for metrics that evolve over time, such as revenue versus forecasted growth, to provide clear comparisons between your historical performances and future projections.

**2. Integrating charts from multiple templates for holistic reporting**           
Some reports benefit from merging charts across different templates to present a holistic view. For instance, sales, marketing, and operations metrics can be visualized together to provide a cross-functional perspective. With the help of Copilot, you can align the colors and formatting of the different charts to create a seamless integration.

Example prompt: Merge charts from the sales and operations templates into a dashboard.

Tip: Use multi-template integration to identify relationships between disparate datasets—such as how marketing campaigns influence sales performance.

**3. Incorporating predictive elements into charts**                                                        
And lastly, adding predictive elements, like trendlines or forecasts, provides insights into future performance. With Copilot in Excel, you can easily integrate these elements based on historical data trends. Copilot can guide you on how to generate predictive trendlines, allowing stakeholders to anticipate future outcomes.

Example prompt: Add a forecast to the revenue chart based on the past 12 months.

Tip: Use predictive visual elements to guide strategic planning and budget allocations for upcoming quarters.

## Conclusion                
These advanced charting techniques—layered combo charts, multi-template integrations, and predictive elements—allow you to visualize complex data in actionable ways.

And, by using Copilot in Excel, you simplify the process by automating configurations, ensuring consistency, and making predictive insights easy to apply. Mastering these innovative techniques will help you create visualizations that, not only inform but also, inspire data-driven decisions.
