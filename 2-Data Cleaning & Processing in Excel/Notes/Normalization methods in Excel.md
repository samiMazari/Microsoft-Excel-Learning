# Normalization methods in Excel  
## High-level overview       
This reading explains methods for normalizing data in Excel. It covers different normalization techniques and their practical applications, helping you prepare data for analysis. For example, it demonstrates how to scale customer satisfaction scores to a 0-1 range for easier comparison across data sets.  

## Learning objective     
By the end of the reading, you will be able to recognize when normalization is needed and understand basic steps to normalize datasets in Excel, preparing for more advanced techniques with Copilot in Excel.      

## Key normalization techniques        
Now that we’ve outlined the importance of normalization, let’s explore the core techniques that can help transform your data for consistent analysis in Excel.

Min-max normalization: Scales values to a fixed range, typically 0-1. This is useful when you need to compare data across different scales.

**Example**: Scaling customer satisfaction scores from 1-10 to a 0-1 range. 

Z-score normalization: Converts data points to reflect how far they are from the mean in terms of standard deviations. This technique is ideal when comparing data that follow a normal distribution.

**Example**: Standardizing test scores to analyze performance deviations from the average.

**Decimal scaling**: Moves the decimal point of values to normalize the data based on the maximum absolute value. This method is less commonly used but can be effective for certain types of financial data.

## Practical applications in Excel    
Using Copilot in Excel, you can automate normalization processes, such as applying min-max normalization to scale variables for comparison. Copilot in Excel helps by suggesting the appropriate function or formula to handle the dataset, reducing manual effort.   

Each normalization technique has its specific applications and is best suited for different types of data based on your analytical objectives. The table below is an overview of the key techniques, detailing when to use them, when to avoid them, and examples to illustrate their applications.

| **When to use:**          | Use min-max normalization when you want to compare data points across different scales directly and maintain the relative distance between values.                                                                                            | Use Z-score normalization when you need to compare data points in terms of their relative positions within the dataset.                                                                                                                               | Use decimal scaling when dealing with large numeric values, especially in financial contexts.                                                                                                               |
| **When not to use:**      | Avoid this method if your dataset contains significant outliers, as they can distort the normalization process.                                                                                                                                | Avoid this method for non-normally distributed data, as the results may not provide meaningful insights.                                                                                                       | Avoid this method for datasets where precise values are critical to analysis.                                                                                                                              |
| **Example:**              | Consider a dataset with customer satisfaction scores ranging from 1 to 10 and sales figures ranging from 0 to 100,000.  <br><br> By applying min-max normalization, these scores can be converted into a 0–1 scale for easier comparison. <br><br> For example, a satisfaction score of 5 normalizes to approximately 0.44, while a sales figure of 75,000 normalizes to 0.75. <br><br> This method clarifies the relationship between customer satisfaction and sales performance, leading to more informed business decisions. | If you have 10 test scores for a class of students (70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 65, 78, 88, 92, 76), the average score is 81.9, and the standard deviation is approximately 8.54. <br><br> Z-score normalization can show how each student’s score compares to the class average. <br><br> For example, if a student scores 85, their Z-score would be approximately 0.36. <br><br> This positive Z-score indicates that they performed better than the average, allowing for quick identification of high and low performers in the class. | Imagine a dataset containing monetary values that range from thousands to millions, such as $1,000, $10,000, and $1,000,000. <br><br> By applying decimal scaling, you can shift these values by moving the decimal point to the left, so that $1,000,000 becomes 1,000. <br><br> This adjustment makes it easier to compare the values on a similar scale while preserving their relationships, simplifying the analysis of financial data. |
