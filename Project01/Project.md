<h1 align="center"> Smartphone Dataset Analysis in Excel</h1>   

## About Dataset     
- This project analyzes a dataset of smartphones sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chaudharisanika/smartphones-dataset), with a focus on how various features affect the price of smartphones.                          
- This dataset contains detailed information on smartphones available in India. explore, analyze, and model smartphone features and pricing trends across major brands like Samsung, OnePlus, Realme, Motorola, and more.             


##  Objective

The goal of this project is to explore how certain technical specifications influence smartphone prices. Specifically, we aim to analyze the relationship between **price** and the following features:

- **RAM capacity**  
- **5G support**
- **NFC support**
- **IR Blaster support**
- **Battery capacity**
- **Fast charging availability**





##  Steps Performed

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns
   - Standardized units (e.g., RAM in GB, Battery in mAh)

2. **Feature Categorization**
   - Grouped RAM into categories (e.g., ≤4GB, 6GB, 8GB, 12GB+)
   - Battery capacity grouped (e.g., <4000mAh, 4000–5000mAh, >5000mAh)

3. **Exploratory Analysis**
   - Created pivot tables to analyze average price per feature category
   - Compared price distributions for phones with and without:
     - 5G
     - NFC
     - IR Blaster
     - Fast Charging
   - Used bar charts and box plots to visualize patterns

4. **Insights Extraction**
   - Identified which features are most associated with higher prices
   - Compared combinations of features (e.g., 5G + Fast Charging)



##  Key Insights

- Phones with **5G support** are, on average, more expensive than those without.
- **Higher RAM** correlates with significantly higher price tiers.
- **Fast charging** and **NFC support** are more common in mid-to-high-end devices.
- **Battery capacity** above 5000mAh doesn’t always increase the price significantly — suggesting it's not a premium-only feature.
