**Learning objective**                          
By the end of this reading, you will be able to use the basic features of Excel to manage and share your data efficiently.         

**Copying and pasting data**                         
Copying and pasting data in Excel is one of the most fundamental skills. Whether you're duplicating information within the same worksheet or moving data across different workbooks, understanding how to use these features efficiently can save you a lot of time.                 

**How to copy and paste**      
Select the data: Click and drag to highlight the cells you want to copy.                      

Copy the data: Right-click within the highlighted range, and select Copy from the context menu, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + C.       

Select the destination: Click on the cell where you want to paste the copied data.                   

Paste the data: Right-click and select Paste, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + V.                                 

Excel also offers advanced paste options, such as Paste Special, which allows you to paste values, formats, or formulas independently. You can access this by right-clicking on the destination cell and selecting Paste Special:                  
           
**Practical tips**         
Copy formulas: When copying cells that contain formulas, Excel automatically adjusts the cell references relative to the new location. This feature is known as relative referencing. If you want to keep the original cell references, use absolute references by adding a dollar sign ($) before the column and row identifiers.            

Paste values only: Sometimes, you might only want to paste the values from a cell, not the formulas or formatting. To do this, use Paste Special and select Values.            

**Saving your workbook**
Saving your work is crucial in Excel, as it ensures you don't lose any progress. Excel provides several options for saving your workbooks, catering to different needs.

**How to save**           
Save as: To save a new workbook or to save an existing workbook with a new name or location, click on File and select Save As. Choose the desired location and enter a name for your file.

Save: For quick saves, especially when you've already saved your workbook before, use the Save option by clicking the floppy disk icon on the toolbar or pressing Ctrl + S.       
 
Excel also has an auto-save function, which is incredibly useful for preventing data loss in case of unexpected power outages or system crashes. To enable auto-save, go to File, select Options, then Save, and ensure that the "AutoSave OneDrive and SharePoint Online files by default" option is checked.                        

**Practical tips**            
Make use of version control: To keep track of different versions of your work, use Save As to create copies with incremental version numbers (e.g., Project_v1.xlsx, Project_v2.xlsx).

Note file formats: Excel supports various file formats, including XLSX (default), this is the recommended format, XLS (for compatibility with older versions of Excel), and CSV (for simple text data). Choose the format that best suits your needs.                                

**Inserting data**                                     
Inserting data into Excel is the core function you'll perform. This involves entering numbers, text, dates, and even formulas into cells. Understanding how to insert and manage data efficiently is essential for creating useful spreadsheets.

**How to insert data**                                               
Select a cell: Click on the cell where you want to insert data.                           

Type your data: Start typing the text, number, or formula you want to insert.                                    

Confirm the entry: Press Enter to confirm and move to the next cell, or use the arrow keys to navigate to another cell.                                                          

An alternative is to click on the cell where you want to insert data and begin typing directly into the formula bar. When you are done, press enter to move to the next cell.       

You can also insert entire rows or columns:                                                          

Insert rows/columns: Right-click on a row number or column letter where you want to insert a new row or column. Select Insert from the context menu.                                        
**Practical tips**
Use data entry shortcuts: Use the Tab key to move to the next cell to the right, or Shift + Tab to move to the previous cell. This can speed up data entry significantly.

Use autofill: Excel's autofill feature can save you time by automatically filling in a series of numbers, dates, or other patterns. To use autofill, click and drag the small square at the bottom-right corner of a selected cell.        

**Exporting files**
Exporting your Excel file to different formats can be necessary for sharing your data with others who may not have Excel, or for importing into other software.

**How to export**
Open the file menu: Click on File in the top-left corner.            

Select Export: Choose Export from the menu options.                                      
               
Choose the format: Select the desired file format, such as PDF or CSV. Follow the prompts to complete the export process.                    

**Practical tips**
Export as PDF: Exporting your Excel file as a PDF can be useful for sharing reports or other documents that you don't want others to edit. PDFs are also widely compatible with various devices and operating systems.

Use CSV for data import/export: The CSV format is ideal for exporting data that will be imported into databases or other applications. It strips away all formatting and retains only the raw data, making it easy to use in different contexts.   

**Sharing workbooks**    
Collaboration is a key aspect of many projects, and Excel makes it easy to share workbooks with others. Whether you're working in a team or sharing data with clients, understanding how to share your Excel workbooks is essential.       

**How to share:**              
Click on Share: In the top-right corner of the Excel window, click the Share button.                

Enter email addresses: Input the email addresses of the people you want to share the workbook with.       

Set permissions: Choose whether you want the recipients to be able to view or edit the workbook.              

Send the invitation: Click Send to share the workbook.            

Excel also integrates with cloud services like OneDrive and SharePoint, making it even easier to collaborate in real time with others.          

**Practical tips:**         
Sharing links: Instead of sending an email invitation, you can also generate a shareable link that you can distribute through other means, such as messaging apps or project management tools.         

Track changes: When sharing a workbook for collaboration, enable the track changes feature to keep a record of all edits made by different users. This can help manage contributions and reverse unwanted changes.                

**Conclusion**             
Understanding these basic features of Excel will help you manage your data more effectively. Whether you're copying and pasting data, saving your work, inserting data, exporting files, or sharing workbooks, mastering these tasks will improve your efficiency and productivity. Practice these skills regularly to become proficient in Excel and leverage its powerful capabilities to meet your data management needs.
